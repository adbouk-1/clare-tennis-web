    Here you can find and register to all the events happening at clare tennis, including inter-collegiate
    matches, practice sessions and social events.

    <br />
    UPDATE: Clare has given us the green light to use the Queen's grounds, which is great because there are more 
    tennis courts and its closer than the Clare courts were. It was a bit too short notice to organize 
    anything this weekend however, so I've sent an email to book the courts for next weekend. I'll keep you
    posted once I hear back from the groundsman about the date and time, depending on availability. 
    Thanks for your patience!
